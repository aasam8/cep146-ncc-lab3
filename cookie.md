# Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe

## Ingredient notes
* Butter: This recipe uses melted butter. I prefer to use salted butter, but you can use unsalted butter if you prefer.
* Sugars: This recipe uses both brown sugar and granulated (white sugar). You can use either dark or light brown sugar. Dark brown sugar will give you a slightly richer flavor.
* Measuring Flour: If you aren’t weighing your ingredients, I can’t recommend that enough. If you are using measuring cups, be sure to sift or stir the flour before measuring. Flour packs easily and using too much flour in cookies will give you dry, crumbly dough and cookies that don’t spread.
* Salt: Kosher salt is a larger-grain salt that isn’t as “salty” as table salt. If you’re using table salt, be sure to use 1/4 teaspoon.
* Chocolate Chips: I use semisweet chocolate chips. You can use another type of chocolate chip, like milk or semisweet, if you prefer. You could even use white chocolate chips if you like.

## How to make chocolate chocolate chip cookies
Here you’ll find step-by-step photos showing how to make the cookies. The full recipe with ingredient amounts and full directions is below.
Step 1: Microwave the butter in a large, microwave-safe bowl for about 40 seconds. Butter should mostly melted.   
Step 2: Whisk the butter until it is completely melted. If it doesn’t melt completely or is pretty solid (like the picture above right), microwave it for a few more seconds until it melts and is liquid (like the melted butter around the butter in the picture on the left).
Step 3: Add the sugars. It will be a little thick and sandy at this point but mix until well-combined.
Step 4: Stir in vanilla and egg until incorporated.
Step 5: Add the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Please read the recipe note about properly measuring flour.  
Step 6: Mix dough until just combined. Dough should be soft and a little sticky but not overly sticky.
Step 7: Stir in chocolate chips.
Step 8: Scoop out 1.5 tablespoons of dough (medium cookie scoop) and place 2 inches apart on baking sheet.   
Step 9: Bake for 7-10 minutes, or until cookies are set. They will be puffy and still look a little underbaked in the middle.

>> I highly recommend mixing the cookies by hand. You can use an electric mixer, but hand mixing helps to avoid overworking the dough.
>> One of the keys to make soft cookies is slightly underbaking the cookies. This means that the edges should look set but the middles should still look puffy and soft.
